# CerebellarDysfunction
This repository contains code analysing a pilot scRNA-seq dataset, from the cerebellum of mice which are either WT or contain a mutation in a Transcription Factor (TF), which is important for cerebellar development.

scanpyQC.ipynb QC's, normalises, clusters, and annotates the cells.
deeper_analysis assess the effect of the mutation on gene and gene-set expression in very cluster, developmental pseudotime trajectories, and predicts target genes of the TF using a random forrest model.
